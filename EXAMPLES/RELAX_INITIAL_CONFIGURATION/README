## Overview ##
This example uses a modification to the coarse grained DNA model
to allow an initial configuration, which would usually have an 
infinite/undefined potential energy, to relax into a structure with
finite energy in the coarse grained model. In this case the
structure is a tile-L.

## Running ##
Use ./run.sh to run the simulations. 


## Explanation ##
In both simulations, the bonded backbone-backbone FENE potential 
is replaced with a constant force (linear potential). First a 
simulation with a weak force constant is run. This gently brings
the structure into a roughly relaxed configuration, which is saved 
as relaxed_weak.conf. Then a second simulation is run with a 
stronger force constant and a very strong thermostat. This forces 
the bonded backbone-backbone distances to be very close to the 
FENE minimum distance, and the strong thermostat refreshes the 
velocities every step to stop the system falling apart. If this 
second simulation was not run, some of the bonded backbone sites 
would probably be too far apart. The final output is saved as 
relaxed.conf. At this point it is advised that you check that the 
system looks reasonable. The system can then be simulated as normal 
from this starting configuration with the normal DNA model, using 
input_go.

Note that this exact procedure may not work for every stressed
configuration!

## Input Options ##
In the input file, set

interaction_type = DNA_relax

to use the alternative interaction. The functional form of the 
potential must be set with

relax_type = <constant_force || harmonic>

There is also an optional parameter that allows the user to set the
strength of the potential. By default the strengths are 1 for the
constant force potential and 32 for the harmonic spring potential
(the latter gives the best harmonic approximation to the FENE 
potential used in oxDNA)

[relax_strength = <float>]

## Implementation ##
The interaction is implemented in src/Interactions/DNAInteraction_relax.cpp
