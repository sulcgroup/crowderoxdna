cadnano_interface.py

Interface between json files produced by cadnano and CUDADNA. Outputs are CUDADNA conf and top files.

===options===
-cadnano_type
Depends on what version of cadnano was used to produce the json file; For cadnano.air use he(xagonal), for cadnanoSQ.air use sq(uare)

-nupack
Instead of producing a CUDADNA configuration, the program can produce a scaffold-staple pattern from the json file (under construction).

-side
Choose the size of the simulation box, in simulation units

===relaxing the configuration===
CUDADNA systems produced by this program will explode when if put straight into CUDANDA under typical conditions. They must first be 'relaxed' into sensible configurations by running them in CUDADNA with a special input file (see input_relax). This input file sets the Newtonian steps very low, the chance of brownian interaction very high, and the temperature very low. After 100 CUDADNA steps in these conditions the configuration will be safe to run under any conditions.

===melting origamis===
It may be desirable to melt the origamis produced by this program, in order to simulate their assembly. This is acheived simply by running the configuration in CUDADNA at a temperature of 100C for a few hours.

===example===
python ~/CUDADNA/UTILS/cadnano_interface.py sq_rectangle_origami.json sq

produces conf and top files of a rectangle origami, which now needs relaxing before it can be simulated under most conditions in CUDADNA
