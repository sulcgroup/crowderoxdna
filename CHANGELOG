v 2.2.2 (June 2015)
	Fixed the hairpin example (see https://sourceforge.net/p/oxdna/discussion/general/thread/92fbef91/?limit=25#3c9b)

v 2.2.1 (May 2015)
	This release fixes a serious bug that could affect the calculation of the number of cells along 
	the box. In some cases this bug could affect the simulation outcome, as not all interacting
	pairs would be seen as such. All CPU backends (MD, MC, VMMC) were affected by this bug. 

v 2.2 (April 2015)
	This release includes the finalised code implementing the oxDNA2 model. In addition there are
	numerous bug fixes, more helpful error messages and other messages to the user, fixes to the 
	examples and various new features.
	- Added support for the oxDNA2 model. See the oxDNA wiki for more information. Use it by setting 
	interaction_type = DNA2 in the input file. The salt concentration must also be specified.
	- Added more observables.
	- Added more external forces.
	- Added GPU support for the salt-dependent RNA model.
	- Updated the syntax for the CPU order parameter parser (the old syntax still works). Non-
	consecutive numbers and letters can now be used to label particle pairs, and pairs can be added
	as lists. See commit message for revision 6431.
	- The Langevin thermostat may now be used on GPUs.
	- Reworked the way the oxDNA code handles plugins. It is now possible to use custom names for 
	the functions that act as entry points for the shared libraries. See the documentation in the 
	PluginManager class.
	- Various improvements to the python utility scripts.
	
v 2.1 (June 2014)
	This is mostly a bug-fixing release. We have fixed a few issues with different compilers
	and platforms and a few severe bugs that could result in segmentation faults.
	- Added support for interaction plugins. Now you can write separate classes to manage custom 
	interactions and load them in oxDNA as plugins. The mechanism is very similar to the one that
	manages observable plugins. See PluginManagement/PluginManager.h for additional documentation.
	- Added a new, improved and safer input parser. User-wise, the only difference with respect to
	the old parser is that it is now possible to put more than a single key-value pair on the same
	line by separating them with semicolons (e.g. key1 = value1; key2 = value2) 
	- Added salt-dependent DNA and RNA interactions. Note that these are still under development
	and then we advise not to use them as they are still subject to changes and possibly unstable.
	- A SRD (stochastic rotational dynamics) thermostat has been added. It works on both CPUs and
	GPUs. It seems working but we did not have thoroughly tested it. Use it at your own risk.
	- Added many observables (in the Observables folder).
	- Plenty of bugfixes, see commit messages for more information.

v 2.0 (March 2014)
	First release on sourceforge.
