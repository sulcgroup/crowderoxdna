/**
 * @brief This class implements the thermostat introduced in the paper
 * "Canonical sampling through velocity rescaling"
 * by Bussi, Donadio and Parrinello (JCP 126, 014101, 2007).
 * This is a canonical thermostat which is good for atomic and molecular systems. It contains
 * a stochastic evolution of the kinetic energy. It is supposed to be an improvement over 
 * Nose-Hoover or other thermostats. In particular, it is able to sample the fluctuations 
 * of the kinetic energy. Do NOT use for DNA or other coarse grained models since it does
 * not take the solvent into account.
