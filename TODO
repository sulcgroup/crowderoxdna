ARCHITETTURA

a) New parser (maybe)
b) Level up config_info
c) Shape up the new MC stuff
d) Make external forces more similar to interactions and observables

1d) Make it so that it is possible to override (all?) the numerical constant of (at least) the DNA interaction -- DONE FOR RNA, STILL TO BE DONE FOR DNA

7) Make SimManager more parallel friendly (with Petr)

11) Is it possible to have mixed precision on CPU?
