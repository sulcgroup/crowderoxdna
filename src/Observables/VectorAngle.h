 * @brief Outputs either the cosine of the angle between one of the orientation vectors of neighbouring particles (if angle_index = 1,2,3), OR the amount of twist (measured in turns). 
 *
 * To use this observable, use type = vector_angle.
 *
 * This observable takes four optional arguments

first_particle_index = <int> (defaults to 0. index of the first particle on which to compute the angle with the next particle)

last_particle_index = <int> (defaults to the index of the first-but last bead in the same strand as the first particle. Therefore, if I have a strand of N beads, the last one will be the one with index N-2. This is because the last bead is atypical in the TEP model (e.g. it's aligned with the vector before it rather than the one in front of it.). index of the last particle of the chain on which to compute the angle. )

angle_index = <int> (defaults to 1. Can be 1,2, or 3 depending on which orientation vector we want to compute the cosine, or 0. In that case it measures the amount of twist, defined as in the TEP model:
 (1 + v2.v2'+v3.v3')/(2*pi)*(1 + v1.v1')
 where v1, v2 and v3 are the orientation vectors of the first particle in a pair and v1', v2' and v3' are the orientation vectors of the following particle.

print_local_details = <bool> (defaults to true. If true, print the quantity relative to each pair of particles. Otherwise, print their average (for angle_index == 1,2,3) OR their sum (that is, the total twist, for angle_index = 0).
